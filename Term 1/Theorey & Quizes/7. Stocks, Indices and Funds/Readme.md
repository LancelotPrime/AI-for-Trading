# Stocks, Indices and Funds

## Definitions

### Index 
* Aggregated value of a group of stocks as a single number. E.g. S&P500 and DJIA (Dow Jones Industrial Average) for USA. They are *virtual profiles* and are not actual funds that people invest in.
* Indices track subgroups of the market, and may be designed specifically to track stocks in the same stock exchange, same country, or same sector.
* Indices give investors a measure of the market’s status.
* Professional investment managers may use indices as benchmarks against which they can evaluate their own fund’s performance.

### Market Captialization

Market capitalization refers to the total dollar market value of a company's outstanding shares of stock. Commonly referred to as "market cap," it is calculated by multiplying the total number of a company's outstanding shares by the current market price of one share.

### Growth Stock v/s Value Stock

* Growth stock tends to have high growth is sales or earnings and have potential for future growth.
* Values stock tends to be a matured company that has stable sales, revenue and earnings.

### Ratios

* *Price to earnings ratio* : the stock price divided by the company’s earnings per share over the past four quarters. 
* *Price to sales ratio* : the the stock price divided by the sales per share over the past four quarters.
* *Price to book ratio* : the stock price divided by the book value per share.

* The book value is the company’s accounting value, which is assets minus liabilities

* Growth stocks tend to have high price to earnings, price to sales, and price to book ratios.
* Value stocks tend to have lower price to earnings, price to sales, and price to book ratios.


### Free Float
* Free float shares refers to the number of shares that are liquid and tradable on the stock exchange.
* Free float shares may be considered a better measure when calculating market cap because only free float shares can be bought or sold, which means only the trade of free float shares affects the market movement of the stock.

### Active vs. Passive Funds
* Actively Managed Fund: seeks to outperform its benchmark (such as an index).
* Passively Managed Fund: seeks to track its benchmark (such as an index).
* *Note:*  passively managed funds that track an index are also referred to ask “index funds”. An index fund is a fund, not an index.
