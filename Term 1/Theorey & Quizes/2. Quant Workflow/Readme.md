## Overview

A hypothesis is an idea for a way to profit from trading. This hypothesis goes through a several phases of rigrous testing. After coming up with a hypothesis, next comes the research phase. In the research phase, we decide what set of positions to enter, on which assets and at what times in order to get positive future returns. After this phase, comes the testing phase which decides how much money to invest in each asset, in what conditions to exit positions and what are the risks. This is called *back-testing*.

## Types of Trading Strategies

### Single Asset Strategies

An example of *Single asset Strategy* is to just trade on S&P 500 and track its performance. If S&P 500 has been doing well for a while, then you might assume a long position assuming it has momentum.

### Cross-sectional Strategies
Extending pairwise strategy, *cross-sectional strategy* extends this idea to groups of stocks. This type of strategy is also known as *equity statistical arbitrage, equity market neutral investing.* This strategy involves comparing hundreds and thousands of stocks to determine which ones to hold for long and short portfolios.
