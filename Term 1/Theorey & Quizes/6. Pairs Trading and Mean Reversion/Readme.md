# Pairs Trading and Mean Reversion

## Mean Reversion

The two most popular types of trading strategies are momentum and mean reversion. A mean reversion trading strategy involves betting that *prices will revert back towards the mean or average.* Momentum predicts prices will continue in the same direction. 

A simplistic example of a mean reversion strategy is to buy a stock after it has had an unusually large fall in price. When a stock has seen a big drop, thereâ€™s usually a good chance that it will bounce back to a more normal level.
