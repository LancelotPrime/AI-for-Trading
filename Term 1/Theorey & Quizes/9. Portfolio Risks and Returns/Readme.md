# Portfolio Risks and Returns

Consider a scenario where you are constructing a portfolio that comprises of 2 stocks -<br><br>

## Portfolio Variance

The term *Cov* is covariance which is the measure of joint variablity of 2 random variables.

## Covariance

* *Covariance* is the correlation between the two variables times each of ther standard deviations.
* *Correlation coefficient* takes vallues between -1 and 1.

### Portfolio Return and Variance

## Efficient Frontier

The efficient frontier for a given set of stocks gives us the set of portfolios that achieve the highest return for each level of risk. The efficient frontier also contains the set of portfolios that achieve the lowest level of risk for each level of return. We refer to these portfolios along the efficient frontier as market portfolios. As portfolio managers, we would be interested in finding the weights for each stock that create these market portfolios on the efficient frontier.<br><br>

### Acheivable and Unacheivable Sides

The minimum variance portfolio is a single portfolio in the efficient frontier that has the lowest risk.

## Capital Market Line

The Capital Market Line is a graphical representation of all the portfolios that optimally combine risk and return. CML is a theoretical concept that gives optimal combinations of a risk-free asset and the market portfolio. The CML is superior to Efficient Frontier in the sense that it combines the risky assets with the risk-free asset.

### Risk-free Assets
An asset that provides guarenteed rate of returns with no uncertainity. Usually entirely risk-free assets donot exist but rate of return on a 3 month treasury bill is called *risk-free rate.*
